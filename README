Proof of concept code for interacting with Mac OSX's main thread & run-loop.

You can import the package if you want, but its main purpose is to serve as
documentation. Comments are spread between osx.go, osx.m, and test/test.go.
They include references so you don't have to rely entirely on the word of a
complete OSX newbie (me! :) ).

Code is public domain. Adapt it as you see fit and share the results if you like.
